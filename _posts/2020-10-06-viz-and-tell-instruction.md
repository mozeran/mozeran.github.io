title: Viz and Tell Instruction
---
Join us for our first Viz and Tell discussion focusing on instruction hosted by Tess Grynoch and Delores Carlito

As libraries incorporate more data services into their repertoire, data visualization classes are a natural addition to data and software classes already provided by libraries. Each data visualization instructor brings their own approach and knowledge when teaching data visualization. This Viz and Tell will be an opportunity for data visualization instructors in libraries or individuals who are interested in teaching data visualization in libraries to share tips, concerns, and questions with others teaching similar content. We hope you can join us!
