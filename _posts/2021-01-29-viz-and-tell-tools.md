title: February Viz and Tell: Let's talk about visualization tools and software!
---
This Viz and Tell will be a guided discussion about the tools and software that we use for visualization. As we all know from experience, tools and software are part of our daily work and the choices that we make in terms of which ones we teach, and how we teach with them, are critical to our communities. We will discuss why we choose to use certain tools/software and how we teach with them from a more critical and meta perspective.

We look forward to seeing you there and learning from everyone on how to better think about this important topic.
