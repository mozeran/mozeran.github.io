title: Register for our September Live Update

As our projects start to go public, we are excited about building and maintaining active connections to the broad community of individuals teaching and using visualization in libraries. Our first live, virtual update is coming up on **September 22 at 1pm Eastern time (10am Pacific, 5pm UTC)**. We hope youâ€™ll join us to learn more about projects and our plans for the fall.
