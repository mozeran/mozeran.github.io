title: Register for our September Live Update
---
As our projects start to go public, we are excited about building and maintaining active connections to the broad community of individuals teaching and using visualization in libraries. Our first live, virtual update is coming up on **September 22 at 1pm Eastern time (10am Pacific, 5pm UTC)**. 

Tune in to learn about:    
*	The goals of the grant
*	Grant activities and projects, like our resources for new visualization librarians and our instruction modules in progress
*	Upcoming opportunities to join together as a community interested in visualization in libraries
 
We will plan to leave extensive time for public q&a and discussion. We really want to know what the broader community is thinking and doing around data visualization in libraries.
