title: Hosting a data librarian social on December 7
---
We've had a great time hosting the Viz and Tell series this fall, and we wanted to continue in December with a(n even) more casual event. We're putting together a social hour/mixer for data librarians (writ broadly), and we'd love to see you there!

We know it's hard to mingle in a virtual environment, so we've put together a combination of a few different types of spaces to try to help smaller groups find ways to connect. We'll have a general Zoom meeting for gathering, and then we can break out into separate Zoom meetings for specific types of networking. We have also set up a more playful space in [Gather.town](https://gather.town/) for games and mingling and a [dedicated Slack space](https://join.slack.com/t/vizandtell/shared_invite/zt-jab1exfo-Hh2GnkkWWIK1rIM2sBNEXA) to continue the conversation after the 7th.

We hope you can join us!

**December Viz and Tell Social    
Monday, December 7    
12pm Eastern / 11am Central / 10am Mountain / 9am Pacific**
