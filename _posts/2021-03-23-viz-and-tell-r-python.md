title: April Viz and Tell on helpful R and python packages
---
This Viz and Tell will cover packages in R and python that we have found useful in our visualization and instruction work. The organizers will be prepared to show off a few of their favorite packages, but don't be shy! Bring along your own favorites!

(This Viz and Tell will also be lightly themed in honor of Earth Day and Angela's birthday. Come celebrate with us!)

We look forward to seeing you there and learning from each other.
