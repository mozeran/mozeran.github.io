title: Join our November Viz and Tell on Visualization for Assessment
---
Like other organizations, libraries have staff who use visualization to analyze and communicate data about the inner workings of the library. Visualizations for library assessment can build on skills developed in public services around visualization, or they can happen in entirely separate units of the library. Library assessment may mirror assessment in other types of organizations, but it can also be very different -- constrained by small budgets, lack of dedicated staff, data privacy concerns, proprietary systems not well designed for library data, etc. This Viz and Tell will be an opportunity for individuals who use visualizations for internal library operations to share tips, concerns, and questions with others doing similar work. Feel free to bring along sample projects if you'd like to share them.

We hope you can join us!
