## Question & Answer Session

### About Visualization in Libraries
1. I’m curious about how folks have integrated visualizations into library catalogs as a way of recontexutalizing library collections for students
    * An interesting question to start asking all the ILS vendors
        * I agree!
    * Green Glass (OCLC), but behind the seen, HathiTrust
    * Yeah, was thinking of altmetric donuts
1. I wonder if there's any hope for public libraries, given the limits on resources.  Covid has moved usage from buildings to online, but assessment and reporting is traditionally focused on gate count and similar.
    * I’d really love to think more about this and see if there are ways to help public libraries and other libraries with fewer resources, especially for assessment and reporting. Feel free to stay in touch if you’d like to talk more about this, or join in the November discussion!
1. This project is very exciting, kudos to everyone! I was wondering about how this project can connect to the teaching of viz in library science master programs, which is in many cases a bit lacking.
    * Thanks for this! I’m a prospective MLIS student. But given Kahlila’s point, is it more prudent to get a degree in data science and then apply to data-related librarianship positions?
    * Agreed, I would love to see more targeted courses on data services in library schools. Maybe data vis-specific courses are a stretch, but broader data services courses might work.
1. PR and assessment share common goals but they have different goals. What are most common goals of visualization in your project?
1. At a small college library like ours, we don't have a dedicated data/vis/assessment librarian. Are the modules, examples, and upcoming sessions going to be accessible/relevant to librarians for whom data visualization may seem peripheral to their main role as a librarian?
   * combined with response to "hope for public libraries"
   * Thanks, Angela. That's all helpful.

### About Teaching Visualization
1. There are quite a range of tools to create visualizations. One challenge in teaching is determining if we need to teach specific tools, which tools are most appropriate for the discipline, which tools are the best to support.
    * It might also be helpful to discus how we as a community plan on keeping these tool tutorials up to date, when there are updates to software which can change how we need to teach or supportt tool use.
    * This reminds me of supporting citation management tools and needing to select a few to support and then continually stay up to date for teaching purposes.
    * Agreed. Especaily with tools like Adobe or ESRI, which are now moving to be automatic updates online.
1. Have you surveyed or assessed skill/competency levels versus self-estimates of skill for data visualization? I'd love to hear about that.
    * Not as actively myself, but I’m very interested in this! We’re trying to think more directly about assessment with each of our modules.
1. What theories or theoretical frameworks do you each use to situate your reseach?
    * Jacques Bertin semiology of graphic

### About Grant/Project Work
1. Would the Nov session include library visual assessments from collection analysis? Or is this focused on instruction only?
    * No, definitely not focused on instruction! I’m envisioning that we would cover all areas of library assessment - collection analysis, satisfaction surveys, occupancy analysis, etc.
1. Are there training opportunities for interested information professionals/academics as part of the grant? And are these available to those outside the US?
    * We are exploring that. The original purpose of the grant was to support the development of instructional modules, so we do want to preserve resources for those because we think they will be the most helpful for the largest number of people. But we have started talking about mentorship opportunities. Basically, our main training will be delivering the workshops.
1. How much overlap do the different projects have? Are they completely separate projects or are they inter-related/inter-working?
1. Do you envision allowing people to add their own visulizations examples to the Teach Viz by Example?
    * Absolutely! We will depend on it! We have a beta submission system already, but we thought we would wait to release it until we have done more user testing on the interface.
    * Great! I noticed that two of yoru examples are ones that I use regularly in my teaching around data viz, so I would love  to adapt the ones you have already shared to my teaching as well as to to add more from my stock to your list
1. Are the examples in the repository going to be licensed in any particular way or will it include copyrighted examples?
    * We’ve definitely talked about licensing issues, and we may still have some work to do on that before we go fully live. Our hope is that we’ll be able to include copyrighted examples under some kind of fair use (commentary, educational, etc.).
    * Yeah, sounds like a good approach. Great work here, Angela!
1. "How did you come to 1 meeting a month frequency? Would it not be better to have 2 meetings a month? Ideally where one day is tuesday and then an other day, in case of scheduling conflicts."
1. When discussing basic literacy around data visulisation compherension and development, I have noticed in my own work that studnets often turn to us for an intorudcttion to base concepts. I saw on the website there is an interest in teaching critical literacies at an undergraduate level, have you all discusssed what visulisation ideas are most critically needed?
    * Haha, yes! We brainstormed a Data Viz 101 for undergrads just a few weeks ago
    * Yes, it was the libraries! And yes, we see both students, faculty, as well as staff. I have had a lot of administrators reach out as well.
    * Sorry, the link you were mentioning, was that the report from the august meeting?
1. Is there an intent to include modules/instruction on dealing with perceptual and cognitive biases in data visualization?
1. is the repo for the site private?
    * no, our repos should be public
    * what is the github.com link?
    * https://github.com/visualizingthefuture
    * And https://github.com/visualizingthefuture/visualizingthefuture.github.io
1. How do people submit pull requests?

### About Doing Visualization
1. Would love some examples of using large data sets - perhaps a community of interest on that?
1. Please let us know whether there are resources about standardized formats for organizing data to create network diagrams and whether there are any recommendations for free, easy-to-use and install tools that could be used with the standard format.
    * For network visualization, I haven’t checked in a while, but I think Graph Commons was really doing interesting things and make network data easier to produce and use. Maybe also Flourish?
    * Gephi is a free network visualization tool, too (or was free last time I checked)
    * Yes, also Cytoscape, if you are looking for downloadable tools
    * I have another tool I’ve liked, but will need to look it up
    * Downloadable tools that are easy to install and use standard formats
    * Some answers from chat: Gephi, Cytoscape, Graph Commons, Flourish. The basic formats may vary from tool to tool, but often they will support one spreadsheet of “node” information and one spreadsheet of “edge” information
    * Thanks for the Graph Commons recommendation!
1. we are talking about data visualization, what specific data do you need to visualize and why?
    * That really varies! I think every workshop might need slightly different data to visualize.
