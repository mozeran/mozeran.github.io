title: Recording and Notes from our September Live Update
---
We had a wonderful audience for our webinar on September 22. At one point we had 135 attendees participating, and our Q&A session was full of excellent questions and thoughts.

If you weren't able to make it, or you'd like to review some of the slides or discussion, we'll share all of that below.

## Question & Answer Session

### About Visualization in Libraries
1. Iâ€™m curious about how folks have integrated visualizations into library catalogs as a way of recontexutalizing library collections for students
    * An interesting question to start asking all the ILS vendors
    * Green Glass (OCLC), but behind the seen, HathiTrust
1. I wonder if there's any hope for public libraries, given the limits on resources.  Covid has moved usage from buildings to online, but assessment and reporting is traditionally focused on gate count and similar.
1. This project is very exciting, kudos to everyone! I was wondering about how this project can connect to the teaching of viz in library science master programs, which is in many cases a bit lacking.
1. PR and assessment share common goals but they have different goals. What are most common goals of visualization in your project?
1. At a small college library like ours, we don't have a dedicated data/vis/assessment librarian. Are the modules, examples, and upcoming sessions going to be accessible/relevant to librarians for whom data visualization may seem peripheral to their main role as a librarian?

### About Teaching Visualization
1. There are quite a range of tools to create visualizations. One challenge in teaching is determining if we need to teach specific tools, which tools are most appropriate for the discipline, which tools are the best to support.
1. Have you surveyed or assessed skill/competency levels versus self-estimates of skill for data visualization? I'd love to hear about that.
1. What theories or theoretical frameworks do you each use to situate your reseach?

### About Grant/Project Work
1. Would the Nov session include library visual assessments from collection analysis? Or is this focused on instruction only?
1. Are there training opportunities for interested information professionals/academics as part of the grant? And are these available to those outside the US?
1. How much overlap do the different projects have? Are they completely separate projects or are they inter-related/inter-working?
1. Do you envision allowing people to add their own visulizations examples to the Teach Viz by Emaple?
1. Are the examples in the repository going to be licensed in any particular way or will it include copyrighted examples?
1. "How did you come to 1 meeting a month frequency? Would it not be better to have 2 meetings a month? Ideally where one day is tuesday and then an other day, in case of scheduling conflicts."
1. When discussing basic literacy around data visulisation compherension and development, I have noticed in my own work that studnets often turn to us for an intorudcttion to base concepts. I saw on the website there is an interest in teaching critical literacies at an undergraduate level, have you all discusssed what visulisation ideas are most critically needed?
1. Is there an intent to include modules/instruction on dealing with perceptual and cognitive biases in data visualization?
1. How do people submit pull requests?

### About Doing Visualization
1. Would love some examples of using large data sets - perhaps a community of interest on that?
1. Please let us know whether there are resources about standardized formats for organizing data to create network diagrams and whether there are any recommendations for free, easy-to-use and install tools that could be used with the standard format.
1. we are talking about data visualization, what specific data do you need to visualize and why?
