Many organizations engaged in social justice work strive to allocate resources for their communities equitably. Increasingly these organizations seek to include visual and non-visual representations of inequity data in decision-making processes—as use of data replaces use of anecdote. One approach to representing inequity is through opportunity index mapping, whereby several demographic data points are aggregated into a single index score by census tract. The index scores of multiple census tracts are then (often) combined to conform to the geography of existing organizational infrastructure, such as the service area of a public library branch, or boundary of a public school. The aggregation of multiple data points and the translation of multiple geographies into an ‘existing organizational geography’ may have serious implications for data visualization. For example, if you combine a ‘high opportunity’ geography with an adjacent ‘low opportunity’ geography in a visualization, you might distort the way both geographies are treated in decision making. If practical opportunity mapping is to be successful, it must avoid this sort of distortion and still be visually understandable to decision-makers. Which data inputs are selected, and how any existing organizational geographies are visualized may have real-world implications for how organizational resources are allocated.
