I am a data visualization librarian working in a large health sciences library in the middle of a large city in the United States. I am also a brown woman working in a profession that is predominantly (at my most recent check, nearly 88%) white. More specifically, I engage in work that is dominated by the tech industry, which also lacks commitment to diversity, equity, and inclusion. I say this not parrot facts and statistics about the library and technology professions, but rather to provide context to my interest in the topic of critical data visualization, particularly in consideration of race, gender, sexuality, and ability status. “Best practices” and tutorials for data visualization often follow the advice of white, Western, sexist, cisgender, heteronormative, and ableist lines of thinking. Libraries have an opportunity to step into the world of data visualization and empower historically marginalized and underrepresented voices in big data. I would like to explore the intersections of social justice issues and data visualization. If we’re visualizing the future, we need to consider who we’re visualizing for, what we’re visualizing, and why we’re visualizing...
