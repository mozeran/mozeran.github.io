Representing uncertainty is difficult to do in many data visualizations. This is particularly true in spatial data visualizations and cartography, where at least two of the dimensions (x and y) are typically unavailable for representing uncertainty. Despite this, most spatial data have some measure of uncertainty associated with them. This can be spatial uncertainty (e.g. gps error, ambiguity in the border between polygons or raster resampling effects) as well as data uncertainty (e.g. error terms in modeled data or uncertainty measures that come from survey data). The available literature on uncertainty in spatial visualizations tends to be highly complex and focused on advanced, highly computational techniques, making it a daunting topic for novice or intermediate users...
