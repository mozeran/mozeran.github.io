Cass Wilkinson Saldaña is the Social Science and Geospatial Data Librarian in Cornell University's Research & Learning Services unit. Zoë specializes in helping learners & researchers find, interpret, and visualize data across the social sciences. They are particularly interested in creating pathways to critical & feminist data science praxis, surfacing questions of embodiment & queerness in data, and, when not doing data librarian things, playing a lot of pinball.
